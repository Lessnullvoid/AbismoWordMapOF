Graph visualization engine for kinho. 

Part of the Abismo workshops/performance (http://astrovandalistas.cc/abismo).

Uses a graph traversing algorithm to measure distance between video nodes and category/tag nodes. These distances can then be used to create a visualization that hopefully shows how different categories, tags and videos are related.
